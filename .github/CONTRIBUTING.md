## Contributions - How to make them good?

"Making a good contribution is not only about how many lines of code your pull request contains, it is how precisely it solves issues with documentation."

We do not really think about how much code you have fixed or added, we only care if the code is actually valid, works in all environments and conditions,
is precise, is documented, and the report or pull request is understandable by people. We do not really like those contributions that specify commit messages like "fixed" and other
related phrases. They do not tell what the pull request doesn't do and actually does. How about a message like "feat(deps): added conditional statement for uvloop dep on windows"?
This follows semantic versioning([Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)), as well as specifies what the pull request actually does.

Below are some you would need to follow while creating a contribution for our community:

1. Please be mindful to specify what the pull request actually does, how it is optimized compared to the previous code, and how it
   works in all environments and conditions. Also, remember to add comments; they are important to help future developers understand your code.

2. Make sure to attach a picture/long description of the change, since you already specified a short description
   by the point above. By this, we are able to understand the changes more deeply, which ultimately, increases
   your pull request acceptance rate. If you feel like lost, below are some examples of what you would typically require
   to add:

   - What actually happens with the code change.
   - Information about the environment you are working in and how it is optimized for other environments.
   - Summary of the pull request.
   - For an issue/bug report, please check the list in PULL_REQUEST.md, which fits your issue description.

3. Do not open duplicate reports, check if your bug or code change has already been suggested before by someone else.

If the contribution is missing these, we will probably ask for more details from you. If no response is provided, the
issue or pull request will automatically be marked as stale by GitHub.
